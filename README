- add_patient_to_db() #function to be called when saving

- overwrite_patient() #function to be called when saving

- delete_entry_from_db()

- search_args_to_command() #creates SQLite search string

- look_db() #search performer with the command made previously

- on_termination() #makes sure that all data is saved and connection is closed

- convert_db_entry_to_class #takes a tuple from db and creates a class object to manipulate

- append_saved_for_later() #updates the list of unfinished cards

- check_input_none() #some input cannot be none

- check_dupli() #used for filing the form with present data

- class Visit #main object

- new_frame() #creates scrollable frame for inner widjets 

- create_pdf() #implements fpdf package and saves a pdf file. Need to have font ttf file in the folder.



 

Functions defined in patients.py:

- mainwin() #main interface window - consists of 3 tabs. (Saved for later, search, new patient)

- call_saved_for_later_tab() #shows a list of unfinished cards as buttons. Opens editable record with call_form() function

- call_search_tab() #one of the main functions called out by clicking on the constant menu
		    1. Opens the search form and. "Search button"
		    2. Calls print_output()

- new patient button calls blank call_form()

- call_form() #creates empty form for a new record or shows filled record for an existing entry.

- clear frame() #delete widgets in the current frame

- print_output() #1. Calls search_args_to_command() to create SQLite search command. 
		  2. Converts found entries to class Visit()
		  3. Prints the info of found entries with buttons to open the full records


- save_and_report() #write data to a certain table (unfinished cards or completed cards) and reports that entry has been saved. Uses functions add_patient_to_db() or overwrite_patient()

- create_and_report_pdf() #calls for create_pdf

- delete_and_clear() #calls delete_entry_from_db()
